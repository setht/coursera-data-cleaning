## Files Used

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

## Variables Used
- features.txt V2 includes the name of the feature being measured
- activity_labels.txt includes name of activity being measured
- X_train/test includes wide data with columns that correspond to features and rows that correspond to activity labels
- y_train/test include data which has variable that corresponds to activity label and rows that correspond to X_train/test

## Feature variables are as follows:
